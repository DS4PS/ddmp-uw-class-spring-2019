# Why Learn R (or Python)?

Data programming languages are different from traditional programming languages. They were designed to make data analytics fast and powerful. R and Python are two of the primary tools of the data science communities.

This course focuses on R and Markdown (not quite a language, but a formatting convention for data-driven documents). Python and Notebooks are similar tools that you will encounter in this space, and they are somewhat interchangeable. If you start out as a computer scientist or engineer and evolve into working in the data science space you will likely use Python. If you start as as a social scientists or a statistician and venture into the data science space chances are you are using R. The differences between the two is more cultural than practical.

# Getting Familiar with R

If this is your first time working with R, we recommend spending 4 hours to work through some of these examples to become familiar with the syntax and basic data structures:

[Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

```
x <- 1:100
y <- 2*x + rnorm(100)
plot( x, y )
```
