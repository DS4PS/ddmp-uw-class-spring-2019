# Course Description

The course will cover ways that data can be used to improve performance in public organizations, as well as tools and techniques for collecting, analyzing, and displaying data.  Thus, an emphasis will both be placed on the substantive idea behind using data for performance management as well as programming.  The class will be taught in R software and will introduce students to its language, structure, and capabilities for data analysis.   Through  R,  students  will  become  comfortable  inputting,  manipulating,  and  visualizing  data  through  the  software.  In addition to the technical skills gained, students will be introduced to how data can drive performance management through a self-directed project and understand the potential and possible abuses of data to drive public organizations.  As part of the class, students will collect their own data, use that data in  an  individual  experiment  to  test  performance,  and  display  the  outcome  using  a  ’dashboard’ in R.

# Course Objectives

1. Use data analytics to improve performance in public management.  
2. Understand the R language for the collection and manipulation of data.  
3. Produce visualizations in dashboards to ease decision making.  



# Prerequisites 

Students  are  expected  to  complete  this  online  tutorial  prior  to  the  course (just the free material),  or have equivalent experience in R:

# Software

*Students are expected to install the following software on their computers prior to the first week of class:*

*  R (choose according to your Operating System):
https://cran.r-project.org/
*  RStudio Desktop Personal License (choose according to your Operating System)

# Evans School Community Conversation Norms

This course has adopted the Evans School Community Conversation Norms.  Please be aware of these norms in interactions with the instructor and other students.  At the Evans School, we value the richness of our differences and how they can greatly enhance our conversations and learning. As  a  professional  school,  we  also  have  a  responsibility  to  communicate  with  each  other–inside and outside of the classroom–in a manner consistent with conduct in today’s increasingly diverse places of work.  We hold ourselves individually and collectively responsible for our communica- tion by:

* Listening carefully and respectfully
* Sharing and teaching each other generously
* Clarifying the intent and impact of our comments
* Giving and receiving feedback in a “relationship –building” manner
* Working  together  to  expand  our  knowledge  by  using  high  standards  for  evidence  and analysis


## Changes to the Syllabus

The professors reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus during the quarter.  The profes- sors will notify students immediately by email and in class if any changes are made. 


# Grading Policy

Grades consider two elements:

* **Weekly labs**:  Each week students are to complete a set of exercises.
* **Final project**:  Students will prepare a dashboard, in 3 stages:
  * Dashboard plan.  Students should present a dashboard proposal, justifying its creation and importance.
  *  Dashboard  data  repository.   Students  will  prepare  a  repository  with  the  data  to  be used in the dashboard.
  * Dashboard release.

The final grade will be comprised of the following weighted elements:

*  40% for completing the Labs.
*  20% for completing Dashboard plan.
*  20% for completing Dashboard data repository
*  20% for completing Dashboard release.


# Working in groups

This course requires working in groups.  You should have decided who will be in your group by the end of the third week of classes.
