# Course Description

Public agencies are increasingly interested in unlocking the potential of large-scale data to improve service delivery and inform policy efforts. Computational tools capable of making productive use of big data have proliferated in recent years, drastically decreasing the barriers to entry for interested parties. This course will explore the practice of using data to improve organizational performance, including techniques for data collection, analysis, and behavior change. Students will operate as their own laboratory through a data journaling exercise, and devise strategies for incorporating data into management practices of public and nonprofit organizations. 

One of the key course take-aways is that data can make your organization more effective, but data itself is not sufficient without strong management frameworks. The course is built around a quantified-self experiment where you will use life-logging tools and a journaling system to learn about managing information overload and building goal-oriented, evidence-based routines. 

Students will also explore the social, political, and ethical considerations associated with building and managing data analytics programs in the public sphere. Students will engage critical dilemmas of data privacy, data protection, predictive analytics, personalized service delivery and resource provision, algorithmic regulation, and large-scale data analytics for administrative efficiencies and resource management optimization, among others. 

Students will read several case studies that explore the use of data in organizations, will engage in discussions about socio-economic policy considerations, and write policy guidance frameworks on best practices in evidence-based management, open data, and privacy.


# Course Objectives

At the conclusion of this course, each student will be able to:

* Describe how public agencies harness large-scale data to inform policy design, increase stakeholder engagement, and improve service delivery.  
* Intelligently consider the social, political, and ethical considerations when building data analytics programs. 

  



## Assessment of Student Learning Performance & Proficiency: Keys to Student Success

Assigned work, including the course data journaling project, active engagement with weekly readings, and the quality of participation in discussion boards are a critical part of the course learning strategy.  The student’s course grade is a direct reflection of demonstrated performance on these tasks. 

*	Students should take stated expectations seriously regarding preparation, conduct, and academic honesty in order to receive a grade reflective of outstanding performance.   
*	Students should be aware that merely completing assigned work in no way guarantees an outstanding grade in the course.  
*	To receive an outstanding course grade (using the grading scheme described below and the performance assessment approach noted above) all assigned work should completed on time with careful attention to assignment details.   












# Software

*Students are expected to install the following software on their computers prior to the first week of class:*

*  R (choose according to your Operating System):
https://cran.r-project.org/
*  RStudio Desktop Personal License (choose according to your Operating System)

# Evans School Community Conversation Norms

This course has adopted the Evans School Community Conversation Norms.  Please be aware of these norms in interactions with the instructor and other students.  At the Evans School, we value the richness of our differences and how they can greatly enhance our conversations and learning. As  a  professional  school,  we  also  have  a  responsibility  to  communicate  with  each  other–inside and outside of the classroom–in a manner consistent with conduct in today’s increasingly diverse places of work.  We hold ourselves individually and collectively responsible for our communica- tion by:

* Listening carefully and respectfully
* Sharing and teaching each other generously
* Clarifying the intent and impact of our comments
* Giving and receiving feedback in a “relationship –building” manner
* Working  together  to  expand  our  knowledge  by  using  high  standards  for  evidence  and analysis


## Changes to the Syllabus

The professors reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus during the quarter.  The profes- sors will notify students immediately by email and in class if any changes are made. 

# Submitting Assignments

Please submit your assignments in the appropriate column next to your name in the Google Sheets below. Your assignments should be turned in as a R Markdown file in html; please publish your markdown using RPubs so that we can view it. Follow this video for a guide to [Rpubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ36zamYVLg)

The link ypu get from RPubs is the one you will paste to the spreadsheet. Notice that we need to see your work when clicking your link. You can use any other way as long as we can see your work. please verify your link after submitting to the following google sheet.

# Grading Policy

Grades consider two elements:

* **Weekly labs**:  Each week students are to complete a set of exercises.
* **Final project**:  Students will prepare a dashboard, in 3 stages:
  * Dashboard plan.  Students should present a dashboard proposal, justifying its creation and importance.
  *  Dashboard  data  repository.   Students  will  prepare  a  repository  with  the  data  to  be used in the dashboard.
  * Dashboard release.

The final grade will be comprised of the following weighted elements:

*  40% for completing the Labs.
*  20% for completing Dashboard plan.
*  20% for completing Dashboard data repository
*  20% for completing Dashboard release.

Letter grades comport with a traditional set of intervals:

* 100 – 98% = A+ 
* 97 – 94% = A 
* 93 – 90% = A - 
* 89 – 87% = B+ 
* 86 – 84% = B 
* 83 – 80% = B –  
* Below 80% - C, D, F
